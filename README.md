# jythontesting

Just testing some things out with Jython and Kotlin.

I have managed to put together an obj factory in Kotlin for instantiating Jython objects.

To build, just build normally using test.kt as main ig. (will appear in 'out' dir).

normally, ie. by pressing buttons in IntelliJ, or using kotlinc.
